import PBCatcher.Tests.Differential

/-!
Release-time differential test of the fast reflection checker against the
verified step function on every application proof (see
`PBCatcher/Tests/Differential.lean` for the harness). Run from the
project root after `lake build`:

    lake env lean applications/difftest.lean

The verified List-based pipeline is slow; the whole run takes a few minutes.
